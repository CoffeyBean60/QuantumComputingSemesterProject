# QuantumComputingSemesterProject
This repository is used for the semester project of quantum computing to prove that the additional use of the Y basis to the quantum key distribution protocol improves the ability to determine if an attacker has intercepted the secret key.

The code for this project is found in the Jupiter_Project/quantum-key-distribution directory

The code is sorted as follows:
XZ_woInter.ipynb is used to show the success of the quantum key distribution protocol with the use of the X and Z basis.
XZ_wInter.ipynb is used to show how the quantum key distribution protocol reacts to an attacker intercepting the encrypted message while using the X and Z basis.
XYZ_woInter.ipynb is used to show the success of the quantum key distribution protocol with the use of the X, Y, and Z basis.
XYZ_wInter.ipynb is used to show how the quantum key distribution protocol reacts to an attacker intercepting the encrypted message while using the X, Y, and Z basis.
